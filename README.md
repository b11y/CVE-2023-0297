# CVE-2023-0297
pyLoad versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev31 are vulnerable to Python code injection due to the pyimport functionality exposed through the js2py library.


An unauthenticated attacker can issue a crafted POST request to the flash/addcrypted2 endpoint to leverage this for code execution. pyLoad by default runs two services, the primary of which is on port 8000 and can not be used by external hosts. A secondary Click N Load service runs on port 9666 and can be used remotely without authentication.
